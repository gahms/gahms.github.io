Software Engineer by heart. 

I love technology and I love enabling people. I love going broad and I love going deep. Great things appear when ideas are developed and creativity applied together with other smart people.

Currently I am mostly involved in mobile solutions with apps for iOS and Android, native or cross-platform.

Day job at Knowit Miracle, Denmark (nicolai.henriksen@knowit.dk).

At night I co-author the calendar app of my dreams, Month Calendar for iOS.

Software Engineer by heart. 

I love technology and I love enabling people. I love going broad and I love going deep. Great things appear when ideas are developed and creativity applied together with other smart people.

Currently I am mostly involved in mobile solutions with apps for iOS and Android, native or cross-platform.

Day job at Knowit Miracle, Denmark. You can reach me there at <nicolai.henriksen@knowit.dk>.

At night I co-author the calendar app of my dreams, Month Calendar for iOS. Find it on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/month-calendar-2/id412782768)
